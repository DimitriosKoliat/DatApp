This project was implemented by the students of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Ioannina 
Dimitrios Koliatos, George Giatsos and Ioannis Koutroudis, by the supervision of proffessor Panagioths Vassiliadis.

The problem concerning the programming exercise (project) of the course
is data visualization. The goal of the visualization techniques we implemented is
to give the user the information in a way that visually highlights properties, trends and
templates hidden in the data. The main reason for our involvement with
the implementation of the project is the utilization of a large volume of data and the presentation
in an interactive and user-friendly way.

In order to run our project you need to install MySQL and MySQL Workbench, Python and Python MySQL Connector and
Flask.
